      <em>Jan 2025 – May 2025</em>
      <ul>
        <li>Visualized climatological data using ArcGIS Pro to further understanding of meteorological patterns in North Georgia</li>
        <li>Analyzed and interpreted upper-air observations from weather balloon launches</li>
        <li>Participated in weather briefings with NWS meteorologists on weather conditions and forecasts during operational meetings</li>
        <li>Applied radar product concepts from WSR-88D Radar to monitor precipitation, winds, and severe weather</li>

      <em>Sept 2023 – May 2025</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Processed and analyzed sediment core samples, including sub-fossil midge analysis, to reconstruct long-term climate and environmental change</li>
        <li>Utilized ArcGIS Pro to map sediment core collection sites, identifying patterns in paleoenvironmental data</li>
        <li>Contributed to reports and scientific papers communicating findings on climate variability, fire regimes, and forest dynamics in the U.S. Intermountain West</li>
        <li>Applied XRF and X-ray scans to date sediment cores and analyze geochemical properties, supporting paleoclimate reconstructions in the Intermountain West and Himalayas</li>

      <p><strong>Assessing the Role of Spatial Resolution on Climate Modeling</strong><br>
      <em>April 2024 – May 2025</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Explored whether combining 12 km climate data with topographic corrections could approximate the results of 1 km model outputs, aiming to balance model accuracy and computational efficiency</li>
        <li>Analyzed UKCP18 regional climate model (RCM) datasets to evaluate the influence of spatial resolution on the accuracy of meteorological variables</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Assessing Wildfire Impacts on the Mountain Bluebird’s Migration Patterns</strong><br>
      <em>May 2024</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Conducted an in-depth analysis using ArcGIS and Python to examine the correlation between wildfire occurrences and changes in mountain bluebird habitat ranges over a 20-year period</li>
        <li>Mapped high-risk areas susceptible to future wildfire disruptions and identified potential future habitats less affected by wildfires and climate change</li>
        <li>Developed targeted conservation strategies to protect and restore nesting sites in fire-prone regions, ensuring the long-term sustainability of mountain bluebird populations</li>
