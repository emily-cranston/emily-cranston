    <div class="emily-resume-text">
      <p><strong>GIS Intern (Academic) – University of Georgia, Dept. of Geography</strong><br>
      <em>January 2025 – May 2025</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Conducted spatial analysis using ArcGIS to identify food deserts and transit deserts across Tarrant County, TX, based on supermarket access, vehicle ownership, and proximity to transit routes.</li>
        <li>Examined racial and socioeconomic disparities in access to essential services, revealing that food and transit inequities affect both low-income and higher-income communities, with varied impacts across BIPOC populations.</li>
        <li>Created a publicly accessible ArcGIS StoryMap to communicate findings and support equitable planning and policy recommendations.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>UK Climate Modeling Intern – University of Georgia / UK Met Office</strong><br>
      <em>April 2024 – May 2025</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Explored whether combining 12 km climate data with topographic corrections could approximate the results of 1 km model outputs, aiming to balance model accuracy and computational efficiency.</li>
        <li>Analyzed UKCP18 regional climate model (RCM) datasets to evaluate the influence of spatial resolution on the accuracy of meteorological variables.</li>
        <li>Prepared parcel-level shapefiles in ArcGIS Pro for the Lyme National Trust region and collaborated with UK partners to integrate topographic data for high-resolution climate analysis.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Independent Student Research – University of Georgia, Dept. of Geography</strong><br>
      <em>May 2024</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Conducted an in-depth analysis using ArcGIS and Python to examine the correlation between wildfire occurrences and changes in mountain bluebird habitat ranges over a 20-year period.</li>
        <li>Mapped high-risk areas susceptible to future wildfire disruptions and identified potential future habitats less affected by wildfires and climate change.</li>
        <li>Developed targeted conservation strategies to protect and restore nesting sites in fire-prone regions, ensuring the long-term sustainability of mountain bluebird populations.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="emily-resume-text">
      <p><strong>Undergraduate Research Assistant – Environmental Change Lab</strong><br>
      <em>September 2023 – May 2025</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Processed and analyzed sediment core samples, including sub-fossil midge analysis, to reconstruct long-term climate and environmental change, with a focus on identifying abrupt and gradual shifts in climate during the Holocene.</li>
        <li>Utilized ArcGIS Pro to map sediment core collection sites, identifying patterns in paleoenvironmental data across different geographic regions.</li>
        <li>Contributed to the preparation of technical reports and scientific papers that communicate key findings on the connections between climate variability, fire regimes, and forest dynamics in the U.S. Intermountain West.</li>
        <li>Applied non-destructive imaging techniques, including XRF and X-ray scans, to date sediment cores and analyze geochemical properties, aiding in the reconstruction of past climate conditions in the Intermountain West and Himalayas.</li>
