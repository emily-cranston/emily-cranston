## **Food and Transit Deserts in Tarrant County, Texas**

This GIS-based spatial analysis project examines how food and transit deserts intersect across Tarrant County, TX, identifying areas where residents face compounded barriers to food access and transportation. The findings inform planning strategies for addressing local disparities in essential resources.

## **Significance of Study**

Food deserts are defined as areas with limited access to affordable, nutritious food and are associated with higher rates of diet-related illness and food insecurity. Transit deserts are defined as areas with inadequate public transportation, which further isolate communities from basic resources such as jobs, healthcare, and grocery stores.

By mapping where these two types of deserts overlap and analyzing demographic patterns within them, this project supports more targeted and equitable interventions, such as mobile markets or improved transit routes, across Tarrant County, TX

## **Study Area & Data**

- **Location**: Tarrant County, Texas  
- **Unit of Analysis**: Census tracts  
- **Data Sources**:
  - U.S. Census ACS (demographics, income, vehicle access)  
  - FWTA (public transit routes and stops)  
  - Texas Department of State Health Services (supermarket locations)  

---

## **Defining Food and Transit Deserts**

Census tracts were classified using the following criteria:

- **Food Desert**: More than 50% of the population lacks a supermarket within 1 mile (walkable distance)  
- **Transit Desert**: More than 5% of the population does not own a vehicle  
- **Critical Area**: Tracts meeting *both* criteria above (limited food and transportation access)

## **Key Findings**

### **BIPOC Communities**
- Of the eight identified critical areas:
  - **Arlington** had high BIPOC representation (36–49%)
  - **Everman** and **Euless** ranged from 25–50% BIPOC
  - **Azle**, **Lake Worth**, and **Dalworthington Gardens** had <5% BIPOC residents  
- **Conclusion**: While BIPOC communities remain disproportionately affected, access issues also appear in majority-white areas.

### **Low-Income Communities**
- Median household incomes in critical areas varied:
  - **Lake Worth**: ~$25,000 (near poverty line)  
  - **Arlington**: ~$35,000  
  - **Azle** and **Everman**: ~$44,000  
  - **Saginaw**: ~$61,000 (well above poverty line)  
- **Conclusion**: Income correlates with vulnerability but does not fully predict it—some higher-income areas still qualify as critical zones.

## **Discussion**

The intersection of food and transit deserts in Tarrant County reveals a more nuanced landscape than expected. While race and income remain important predictors, several critical areas defy these patterns, indicating that access issues cut across multiple community types.
