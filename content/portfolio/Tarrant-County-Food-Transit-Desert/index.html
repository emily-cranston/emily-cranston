<h2><strong>Food and Transit Deserts in Tarrant County, Texas</strong></h2>

<p>This GIS-based spatial analysis examines how food and transit deserts intersect across Tarrant County, Texas, identifying areas where residents face compounded barriers to food access and transportation. The findings aim to inform planning strategies that address local disparities in access to essential resources.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Significance of Study</strong></h2>

<p>Food deserts are areas with limited access to affordable, nutritious food and are associated with higher rates of diet-related illness and food insecurity. Transit deserts, meanwhile, are areas with inadequate public transportation, further isolating communities from jobs, healthcare, and grocery stores.</p>

<p>By mapping where these two types of deserts overlap and analyzing demographic patterns within them, this project supports more targeted and equitable interventions—such as mobile markets or improved transit routes—throughout Tarrant County.</p>

<h2><strong>Study Area & Data</strong></h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Location:</strong> Tarrant County, Texas</li>
  <li><strong>Unit of Analysis:</strong> Census tracts</li>
  <li><strong>Data Sources:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>U.S. Census ACS (demographics, income, vehicle access)</li>
      <li>FWTA (public transit routes and stops)</li>
      <li>Texas Department of State Health Services (supermarket locations)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Defining Food and Transit Deserts</strong></h2>

<p>Census tracts were classified using the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Food Desert:</strong> More than 50% of the population lacks a supermarket within 1 mile</li>
  <li><strong>Transit Desert:</strong> More than 5% of the population does not have access to a vehicle</li>
  <li><strong>Critical Area:</strong> Tracts that meet <em>both</em> criteria</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>BIPOC Communities</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Of the eight identified critical areas:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Arlington:</strong> 36–49% BIPOC residents</li>
      <li><strong>Everman</strong> and <strong>Euless:</strong> 25–50% BIPOC</li>
      <li><strong>Azle, Lake Worth, Dalworthington Gardens:</strong> Less than 5% BIPOC</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> While BIPOC communities are disproportionately affected, access issues are also prevalent in majority-white areas.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Low-Income Communities</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Median household incomes in critical areas:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lake Worth:</strong> ~$25,000</li>
      <li><strong>Arlington:</strong> ~$35,000</li>
      <li><strong>Azle</strong> and <strong>Everman:</strong> ~$44,000</li>
      <li><strong>Saginaw:</strong> ~$61,000</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> While income is a factor, it does not fully predict access issues—some higher-income areas still qualify as critical zones.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Discussion</strong></h2>

<p>This analysis reveals that the intersection of food and transit deserts in Tarrant County is more complex than expected. Although race and income remain significant indicators, several critical areas fall outside those patterns. This suggests that access disparities exist across diverse communities and require nuanced, localized policy solutions.</p>
