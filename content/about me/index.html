    <p class="emily-page-text">
      I'm Emily â€” an MS Geography + Environment student who is passionate about using geospatial technologies to address climate change and reduce environmental disparities. My interest in geography began when I was young, as I always had an interest in learning about people and places. Through my undergraduate studies I explored human, physical, and urban geographies. When Hurricane Helene struck Appalachia in September 2024, witnessing the social and environmental impacts firsthand solidified my decision to pursue a career using geospatial technologies to support communities facing climate-related challenges.
